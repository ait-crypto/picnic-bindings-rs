# Declarations for the Picnic digital signature scheme

This crate provides the declarations to interact with the shared library of the [optimized implementation](https://github.com/IAIK/Picnic) of the [Picnic](https://microsoft.github.io/Picnic/) digital signature scheme.

Per default, it is required that Picnic's shared library is installed. To fall back to an on-demand static build, enable the `static-fallback` feature.
